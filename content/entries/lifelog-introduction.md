I haven't been very active on my website lately. To be precise, I even took it offline a few months ago since I didn't publish any content in a good while. But why is that?

Even though I got a few writing ideas stored in my folder, I often feel hesitant to publish them, because they seem too unfinished and rough. 

While posting raw ideas and thoughts on X (Twitter) used to be a popular choice in the past, the presence of ads, constant distractions, social pressure and the reliance on the incomprehensible decisions of a wealthy individual do not create the environment I desire.

Introducing [eibensteiner.com](https://eibensteiner.com) is therefore a long-term shot on eliminating all those factors for me and my family. It's an attempt to create a self-hosted log of *thoughts* and *short stories* like the one you are reading right now.
