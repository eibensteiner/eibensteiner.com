As Blockpit began to experience rapid growth, it became crucial to organize our creative chaos. We took a major step by setting up centralized Figma and Notion spaces, making our ideas and guidelines globally accessible. This move was more than just about order; it was about *enhancing our team's productivity* and *quality of output*.

In collaboration with another Product Designer, Brand Designers, and the CPO our major focus was to develop a base-set of [design tokens](https://specifyapp.com/blog/introduction-to-design-tokens) as well as a *new design language* for our components.

The project kicked off with an [interface inventory](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/); a crucial step to understand and categorize each design element we already had. As we sifted through, we cleaned out redundant and inconsistent elements, *keeping only what was essential*.

We established our *foundational set of design tokens* by extracting colors and fonts directly from the components. According to their use cases, these were then systematically organized into [global and alias tokens](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/design-tokens/#Design-token-types).
