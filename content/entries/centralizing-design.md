When Blockpit began to grow rapidly, we recognized the need to centralize our ideas and guidelines. To facilitate this, we created globally accessible Figma and Notion spaces, ensuring a well-executed solution that would enable both designers and developers to not only increase their output but also enhance the quality of their work.

During this period, I was primarily involved in the retail product redesign, collaborating closely with another Product Designer, several Brand Designers, and the CPO. We focused on exchanging ideas and peer-reviewing our results. This collaboration was pivotal in my extensive research and implementation of Design Tokens, which led to the establishment of a new Design Language for our components.

Recognizing that the design system is ever-evolving, we embarked on a foundational project to document colors, fonts, icons, and an initial set of components. The first step in this journey was conducting an interface inventory, categorizing each item and succinctly describing its purpose. This meticulous process helped us eliminate duplicate and inconsistent entries, allowing us to pinpoint the elements we would continue to develop.

Our next focus was on colors and fonts. After gathering all relevant design tokens, we made a strategic decision to categorize them into Global and Alias Tokens. This included Color Aliases, sorted as foreground, background, or border, and Typography Aliases, classified as heading, paragraph, or label.

The project also involved a critical evaluation of our icons and components. We merged several similar components to maintain versatility and atomicity, operating under the hypothesis that fewer components are not only easier to maintain but also more likely to be accepted for use.

Throughout this project, I gained invaluable insights. Among the most significant learnings were the importance of defining processes to keep the system dynamic, the necessity of keeping Figma and Notion synchronized, and the need to balance documentation complexity with the freedom to creatively find the best solutions. This delicate balance was essential in speeding up the process while still fostering an environment where creativity could thrive.
