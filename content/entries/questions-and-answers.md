## How did you find your way into Product Design?

I have always been a design-minded person and after my IT-related studies I was torn between becoming a *Design Engineer* or a *Product Designer*.

But since job titles are just generous tags, trying to categorize people and their work, I would rather call myself a coding designer.

## How does your design process look like?

Like the most Product Designers I’m guided by the Double [Diamond Design Process](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/skills-learning/tools-frameworks/framework-for-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond/).

I think of it as my *baseline toolkit*, adaptable to the complexity of any project by applying different methods and deepening the focus on specific parts of the process.

## What’s your favorite part in the design process?

Based on the Double Diamond Design Process, I prefer working on *each stage of the second diamond* when it comes to pouring all the ideas in a Figma file.

Besides that, I’m passionate about good documentations and love *working on the Design System*.

## What inspires you?

I feel inspired by people who are *building and sharing stuff in public*.

*Twitter* is a great place for finding people like [James McDonald](https://twitter.com/jamesm), [Rasmus Andersson](https://twitter.com/rsms), [Paco Coursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey), [Brian Lovin](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin), [Julian Lehr](https://twitter.com/julianlehr), [Benji Taylor](https://twitter.com/benjitaylor) and many more.

They keep me excited about improving my craft and shipping products with purpose.

## What do you care deeply of?

One of my most important philosophies as a minimalist is *Quality instead of quantity*, which can be applied to almost every area of my life and work.

## What are your interests outside of work?

On sunny days, me and my wife Sarah are enjoying the nature by *travelling around*, while my favorite trip so far has been an exploration of iceland in 2019.

On rainy days, I like to work on my *side projects* or watch a [Juventus](http://juventus.com/) football game.

Besides that, I’m really passionate about a *good cup of coffee*. Sarah and I even started to rank the best coffee beans in a shared Notion list (Cannot recommend [Elbgold Sechs A](https://www.elbgoldshop.com/products/sechsa-1kg-espresso) enough).

## How does your setup look like?

Figma, Notion, Miro, Cleanshot X, Slack, Spotify and VS Code are daily companions for me and my work.

Depending on where I am, I use these tools either on my *MacBook*.

## What music are you listening to?

Especially since I got my Airpods Pro with ANC, I love to immerse myself in *minimalistic and atmospheric music* by [Joep Beving](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2VKfXEWzhUi9siHBDTI02Y?si=e55d503d9b9d4207), [RY X](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2KjAo6wVc9d2WcxdxSArpV?si=-45fECEtSwGb68RS38ihYw) or [Ólafur Arnalds](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7E3BRXV9ZbCt5lQTCXMTia?si=c311a1869c914202).
